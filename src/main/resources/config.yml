# Setting this to true will show the biome name in the server's locale to all players
force_server_locale: true

# By default, in Minecraft Java, all locale names are fully lowercase. However the client's behaviour
# is unpredictable. This setting will convert all locale names to lowercase.
# Disable only if you know what you are doing!

# If a locale file is not found, download it automatically from the link configured below
# By setting this to true, you agree to the configured site's terms of service.

# You can either extract the assets from the client jar and paste it into
# plugins/PlayerBiomes/lang/<locale>.json, or you can set a link to a remote server
# that hosts them as raw json files in the configured path:
# {version} - Server's version [e.g. 1.21.6], {locale} - Locale to fetch [e.g. ta_in]
# The author of this plugin is not responsible for the safety and lifetime functioning of the included link,
# and hence the downloading feature is disabled by default. You can use your own link as long as it
# behaves as previously described.
